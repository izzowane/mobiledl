MobileDL is set of tools for digitizing driver licenses using mobile phones.
It presently has two key applications:

- DLVerifier: This is the mobile application for cops and other law enforcement agents to scan and verify 
  the validity of  digital (or even physical) driver licences.
 
- DLMaker: This is the application for creating, managing and distributing digital driver licenses.

Please note that digital driver licenses are .pkpass files and hence can be installed on iPhone devices using Passbook or 
on Android devices using apps such as PassWallet.
